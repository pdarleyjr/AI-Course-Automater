### Development: Playwright Automation Enhancements

- Implemented comprehensive enhancements to the Playwright automation system:
  - Created specialized utility modules:
    - `time-gated-handler.js`: Intelligent handling of time-gated content
    - `anti-bot-detection.js`: Measures to avoid bot detection
    - `retry-handler.js`: Robust retry and failover mechanisms
    - `quiz-handler.js`: Advanced quiz and exam completion
  - Enhanced core LMS automation with:
    - Human-like interaction patterns (random delays, mouse movements, typing)
    - Browser fingerprint masking to avoid detection
    - Intelligent content analysis and time requirement detection
    - Robust error handling and recovery strategies
    - Enhanced quiz/exam handling with LangChain integration
  - Added configuration options for:
    - Anti-bot detection features
    - Time-gated content handling
    - Retry mechanisms and failover strategies
  - Improved reliability through:
    - Multiple selector strategies for better element detection
    - Circuit breaker pattern to prevent repeated failures
    - Intelligent recovery from common errors
    - Session persistence during long waits
  - Enhanced logging and debugging:
    - Detailed progress reporting
    - Strategic screenshots for troubleshooting
    - Comprehensive error information

### Development: Docker Configuration Fixes

- Fixed PostgreSQL permission issues in Docker on Windows:
  - Changed PostgreSQL volume from bind mount to named volume
  - Added non-root user configuration to avoid permission errors

### Docker Environment Setup

- Created project structure with directories for:
  - `data/` - Persistent data storage
  - `docs/` - Documentation files
  - `letsencrypt/` - SSL certificates
  - `scripts/` - Utility scripts
  - `src/` - Source code for automation

- Created configuration files:
  - `docker-compose.yml` - Docker configuration with Nginx Proxy Manager
  - `.gitignore` - Git ignore file for project
